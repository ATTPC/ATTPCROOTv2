 ATTPCROOT is a ROOT-based (root.cern.ch) framework to analyze data of the ATTPC detector (Active Target Time Projection Chamber) and the p-ATTPC (Prototype). For reference http://ribf.riken.jp/ARIS2014/slide/files/Jun2/Par2B06Bazin-final.pdf. The detector is based at the NSCL but experiments are performed at other facilities as well (Notre Dame, TRIUMF, Argonne...).
 The framework allows the end user to unpack and analyze the data, as well as perform realistic simulations based on a Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) package. 
 The framework needs external libraries (FairSoft and FairRoot https://fairroot.gsi.de/) to be compiled and executed, which are developed by other groups and not directly supported by the AT-TPC group. Please refer to their forums for installation issues of these packages.
