/**
 * @brief Abstract base class for getting current through deconvolution.
 *
 * This PSA method calculates the charge collected over a pad. It operates as a base class
 * where specific PSA methods can be implemented on top of this class to convert the current
 * into hits in 3D space.
 *
 * Mathmatically what this class does is take in an electronic response function r(TB), and stores
 * the FFT of that response function R(k). For the trace recorded in each pad s(TB), we then calculate
 * the FFT of that trace S(k), and divide by R(k). We then apply a low-pass Buttersworth filter of
 * even order n with cuttoff frequency w_c (both specified by the user). This, transformed back into
 * the time domain, should give the input current over the pad.
 *
 * It saves the reconstruced charge as an augment (AtPadArray with name "Qreco") to the
 * pad in the input event
